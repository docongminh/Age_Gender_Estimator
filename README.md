# End-To-End guideline this project
Basically, This project based-on Inception-Architecture to build model for Age Estimation and Gender Recognition Problem
# Project Structure
- Project: 
	- ```inceptionv4.py```        # building model architecture
	- ```training.py```		# Run training model
	- ```finetuning.py```		# Tuning model with new dataset
	- ```data_generator.py```	# Data generate for data augmentation
	- ```demo.py```		# Demo project with model trained
	- ```model_v4```		# Save model trained consists: weights and architecture
